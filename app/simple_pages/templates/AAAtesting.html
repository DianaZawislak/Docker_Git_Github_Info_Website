        <p class="fs-20"><span class="fs-4">T</span>he AAA pattern is a pattern for structuring tests. It breaks each
            test down into three parts – Arrange, Act, and Assert – where each part is a step leading to the next. The
            arrange step sets up the test’s input values. The act step prompts the primary function being tested. And
            finally, the assert step verifies that the output of the function is what was expected.

            In other words, each step in the pattern is a function whose return value is the input of the following
            step.</p>

                <p class="fs-20">The block of code that sets up the conditions for the test action.</p>
                <p class="fs-20">Guidelines</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Use a single block of code with no empty lines.</li>
                    <li>Do not use assert in the Arrange block. If you need to make an assertion about your arrangement,
                        then
                        this is a smell that your arrangement is too complicated and should be extracted to a fixture or
                        setup
                        function and tested in its own right.
                    </li>
                    <li>Only prepare non-deterministic results not available after action.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            <div class="col-4"><img src="{{ url_for('static', filename='images/aaa1.png') }}" class="img-fluid"
                                    alt="aaa1"></div>

        </div>
        <div class="row align-items">
            <div class="col-5 mb-5">
                <h5 class="neonblue">Act</h5>
                <p class="fs-20">The line of code where the Action is taken on the SUT.</p>
                <p class="fs-20">Guidelines</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Start every Action line with result =.

                        This makes it easier to distinguish test actions and means you can avoid the hardest job in
                        programming:
                        naming. When every result is called result, then you do not need to waste brain power wondering
                        if it
                        should be item = or response = etc. An added benefit is that you can find test actions easily
                        with a
                        tool like grep.
                    </li>
                    <li>Even when there is no result from the action, capture it with result = and then assert result is
                        None.
                        In this way, the SUT’s behaviour is pinned.
                    </li>
                    <li>If you struggle to write a single line action, then consider extracting some of that code into
                        your
                        arrangement.
                    </li>
                    <li>The action can be wrapped in with ... raises for expected exceptions. In this case your action
                        will be
                        two lines surrounded by empty lines.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <h5 class="neonblue">Assert</h5>
                <p class="fs-20">The block of code that performs the assertions on the state of the SUT after the
                    action.</p>
                <p class="fs-20">Guidelines</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Use a single block of code with no empty lines.


                    </li>
                    <li>First test result, then side effects.
                    </li>
                    <li>Limit the actions that you make in this block. Ideally, no actions should happen, but that is
                        not always
                        possible.
                    </li>
                    <li>Use simple blocks of assertions. If you find that you are repeatedly writing the same code to
                        extract
                        information from the SUT and perform assertions on it, then consider extracting an assertion
                        helper.

            <h5 class="neonblue">Why is testing important???</h5>
            <p class="fs-20">Goal of python unit testing is to detect as many bugs and inconsistencies in the infancy of
                the application development as possible. This is achieved by designing and scripting accurate and
                quality unit tests that can also serve as detailed documentation for the development process. This
                ensures that bugs and other problems we catch in the first stages of the development, can be fixed by
                the development team.</p>
